	<h3>Download</h3>
	<h4>Fractus Client</h4>
This is what you need to connect to the Fractus network.
If you don't know what you're trying to download, this is probably what you want.
Download this from Github at:

	</div>
	<h4>Fractus Server</h4>
The Server will allow clients to authenticate one another and establish each others' locations.
It's probably better that you use the main one at <i>fract.us</i> but if you have a compelling
reason to host your own, the source code is provided below.  There are no installation instructions
and several dependencies such as MySQL.  The database schema (but obviously not the data) is provided.

	<h4>Fractus Website</h4>
If, for some strange reason, you wish to download the website you are now viewing,
you can find it at:
